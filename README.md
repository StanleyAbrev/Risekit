# Risekit
During this Capstone Project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Risekit website, focusing on conversion pathways, user engagement rates, and general user behavior. The objective was to identify opportunities for improvement in user experience and overall website performance. My involvement in the presentation began at slide 40 and continued until the end.

Key project highlights include:

Conversion Pathway Analysis: I meticulously examined the conversion pathways within the Risekit website, tracking how users navigated through the site and identifying any bottlenecks or barriers that hindered conversions.
Engagement Rate Assessment: I assessed user engagement rates to gain insights into how effectively the website captured and retained user interest. This involved analyzing metrics such as bounce rates, time on page, and click-through rates.
User Behavior Insights: Through data analysis and user tracking, I gained valuable insights into general user behavior on the website. This included identifying patterns, preferences, and areas of user interaction.
Error Detection: I identified and documented website errors, ranging from malfunctioning buttons to overlapping design elements. These findings were crucial in ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience.
The project provided actionable recommendations and insights to enhance the Risekit website's performance, usability, and user engagement. By addressing identified issues and optimizing conversion pathways, the aim was to improve the overall effectiveness of the website in meeting its goals and objectives.

This Capstone Project not only equipped me with valuable skills in web analytics but also contributed to the ongoing improvement of the Risekit website, aligning it more closely with user needs and expectations.
